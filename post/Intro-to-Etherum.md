Ethereum is open access to digital money and data-friendly services for everyone – no matter your background or location. It's a community-built technology behind the cryptocurrency ether (ETH) and thousands of applications you can use today.

Bitcoin white paper was released on October 31 2008 describing a system to allow peer to peer payment without a financial intermediary . The purpose of the bitcoin is only to enable the financial transaction. After it release many felt this innovation can do more then the transaction of currency.One important person among them is Vetalic who created a white paper of his own and published in late 2013.

His intention is to use the same technology to create far more complex applications. He describes it can create a sub crypto currencies ,Domain name registration systems and gambling application. The most important part of this network in something called smart contract. The Ethereum system went online on July 30th of 2015.

## Ethereum is built with the goal of

- Banking for everyone
- A more private internet
- A peer-to-peer network
- Censorship-resistant
- Commerce guarantees

## Ethereum Network

A network is formed by one or more nodes. Nodes are a machine that is running ethereum client.(any type of computer)which can be ran by anyone.

Every node has a separate copy of blockchain, Web3.js other other tools created for developers to create application the communicate with tne network.

****Kind of Blockchain Networks****

**Public blockchains**: A Public blockchain is accessible to anyone in the world. One can read or push transaction on a public blockchain and validate the transactions being executed on the blockchain.

**Private blockchains** : The write permission is in command of a central authority in the network, However, the transaction is fully transparent to every peer in the network.

**Consortium blockchains**: The consensus process is controlled by a pre-defined set of nodes which are trusted; for example, A network consists of academics institutions in the world each govern a single node and the blocks are validated by n number of signatories within the network.

****“MainNet”: The main Ethereum Network****

There is only one public Ethereum Mainnet. Applications that are built on the Mainnet are able to interoperate, similarly to how applications built on the Internet can connect to each other, leveraging the full potential of decentralized blockchain.

****“TestNet:" the Test Ethereum Network****

Before a project launches on the Ethereum blockchain (or before changes are made to the blockchain itself), a version is deployed to an Ethereum Test Network (“*testnet*
”), which simulates Ethereum

- **[Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/)**: A proof-of-work blockchain that most closely resembles Ethereum; you can easily mine faux-Ether.
- **[Kovan](https://kovan.etherscan.io/)**: A proof-of-authority blockchain, started by the Parity team. Ether can’t be mined; it has to be [requested](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/faucet).
- **[Rinkeby](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/)**: A proof-of-authority blockchain, started by the Geth team. Ether can’t be mined; it has to be [requested](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/).

## Wallet and Account

wallets are applications that let you interact with your Ethereum account or any othe crypto account. Think of it like an internet banking app – without the bank. Your wallet lets you read your balance, send transactions and connect to applications.

Your wallet lets you connect to any decentralized application using your Ethereum account. It's like a login you can use across many dapps.

An Ethereum account is an entity that can send transactions and has a balance.

An Ethereum account has an Ethereum address, like an inbox has an email address. You can use this to send funds to an account.

An account has three address in it for performing the communication

- The private key should be never shared. As it is used to sign all our transaction in the network.Provide Authentication to our activities.
- the Account address is how other use can find us and intract or transfer money.
- the public key is used for other to decrypt our communication works similar to the address.

A wallet is a product that lets you manage your Ethereum account. It allows you to view your account balance, send transactions, and more. Most wallet products will let you generate an Ethereum account. So you don't need one before you download a wallet.

## Where to buy ETH ?

You can buy ETH from exchanges or from wallets directly.

- **Centralized exchanges**

    Exchanges are businesses that let you buy crypto using traditional currencies. They have custody over any ETH you buy until you send it to a wallet you control.

- **Decentralized exchanges (DEXs)**

    If you want more control, buy ETH peer-to-peer. With a DEX you can trade without giving control of your funds to a centralized company.

- **Wallets**

    Some wallets let you buy crypto with a debit/credit card, bank transfer or even Apple Pay. Geographical restrictions apply.
